# PHP-Webshell-Detection-via-Opcode-Analysis
This repository detects PHP webshells by converting PHP code to opcode and analyzing it using Opcode Double-Tuples (ODTs), which combine opcode instructions and operands. The opcode undergoes advanced processing, including filtering, decoding, and semantic preservation, to identify malicious patterns effectively.
